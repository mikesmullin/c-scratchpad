# C Scratchpad

This is just a scratch program written in the C language.

I use it to quickly iterate on small ideas in C.
I will sometimes iterate here first, because its quick, then copy working code to my larger project.

Similar to what I would do on [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/mikesmullin) with Javascript.

## Usage

- Start the watch loop process.
   ```
   C:\> node build_scripts\\Makefile.mjs watch
   ```
- Edit and save [test001.c](src/tests/unit/test001.c)
- Watch console output to see your code automatically recompiled + run on save.
